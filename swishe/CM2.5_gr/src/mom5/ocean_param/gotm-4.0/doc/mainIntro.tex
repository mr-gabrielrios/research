\section{The GOTM main program \label{sec:mainIntro}}

\subsection{Introduction}
The purpose of the main program and its associated module {\tt gotm}
is the construction of a solid framework for the interaction of all
components of GOTM. Almost no actual computations are carried out
inside this part of the program. However, the most important processes
are triggered from there: the initialization of all lower-level modules 
is actuated and the time stepping of the differential equations is managed.
Also calls to subroutines responsible for the air-sea interaction and
the ouput of the results are managed. Details for each of the (few) routines
are given in the following.
