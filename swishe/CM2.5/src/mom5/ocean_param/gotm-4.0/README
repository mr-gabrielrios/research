################## README ################################################

This directory contains files distributed with GOTM (General Ocean
Turbulence Model).  MOM provides interface to this code, yet MOM
developers do not support GOTM.  Hence, MOM users who employ GOTM for
MOM simulations should register with the GOTM user community in order
to keep abreast of GOTM changes that may affect your research.

Note regarding the IBM-compiler xlf:

For compatibility with the definition of variables of type "real" in mom, 
which is transformed to REAL*8 with the compiler flag -qrealsize=8,
the switch __aix is added to cppdefs.h. Please note, that __aix is set
by mkmf. Hence, compiling this code independent from the main mom code is
not recommended. Especially the usage of "double precision" leads
to type mismatch in the FORTRAN90/95 interface between mom and GOTM.

About GOTM

The GOTM package consists of the FORTRAN90 software, a number of idealised and 
realistic test cases, and a scientific documentation, all published under the 
GNU public license. THIS LICENCE REQUIRES THAT ANY CODE USING AN ORIGINAL OR 
MODIFIED VERSION OF GOTM MUST BE MADE PUBLICALLY AVAILABLE WITHOUT ANY 
RESTRICTIONS. The complete package is available from the GOTM homepage at 
www.gotm.net, where also the online-documentation can be found.

If you find a bug in GOTM, please let us know using the bug-list on 
www.gotm.net or by sending an E-mail to gotm-users@gotm.net. If you plan an 
extension to GOTM for your own research project, please contact us via 
gotm-users@gotm.net before you start. It occurred a number of times in the 
past that different groups started working on very similar projects without 
knowing from each other - which would be exactly against the spirit of the 
GOTM project.
