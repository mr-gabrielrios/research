# Model run list readme
**Objective:** the objective of this readme is to catalog(ue) all the model runs I perform for future reference to make data access easier, and hopefully, to avoid unnecessary model runs.

| Model name | Run name | Start date | End date | Description | Model configuation path | Data storage path  |
| ----------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- | -----------|
| AM2.5 | CTL1990s | 0101-01-01 | 0200-01-01 | Control AM2.5 run using 1990s initial conditions. | /tigress/wenchang/AM2.5/exp/CTL1990s | /tigress/wenchang/MODEL_OUT/AM2.5/CTL1990s_tigercpu_intelmpi_18_540PE |
